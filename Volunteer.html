    <h1>Green Summer Volunteer 2024 - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</h1>

    <img src="images/volunteer.jpg" alt="Teaching kids during Green Summer 2024">

    <p>In the summer of 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer for the <strong>Green Summer Campaign</strong> in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
       As part of this initiative, I dedicated my time to teaching English to underprivileged children, helping them develop essential language skills. 
       The experience was both rewarding and inspiring, as I witnessed the enthusiasm and progress of these young learners.</p>

    <p>The program not only allowed me to contribute to the local community but also deepened my understanding of cultural exchange and education's impact. 
       It was a meaningful journey filled with learning, teamwork, and unforgettable moments.</p>
